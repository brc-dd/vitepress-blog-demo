Open source runs the world. But who runs open source? Open source project maintainers are behind the software we use everyday. Yet project maintenance is intense work, and it doesnâ€™t happen in a vacuum.

Welcome to Maintainer Month. ðŸŽ‰ During the month of June, weâ€™re holding space for open source maintainers to gather, share, and be celebrated.

Maintainer Month is an open source project bookmarking a month to collectively contemplate open source maintainership, whatever form that takes. Various organizations, projects, and companies are running activities, events, and distributing resources. Do you have an open source activity or resource for open source maintainers? Submit a pull request to join in on Maintainer Month, and invite the community to participate.
