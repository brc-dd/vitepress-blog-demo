The recently-ended Gamedev.js Jam 2022 encouraged game developers to create web games and share their sources on GitHub. Let’s look at the best 13 entries and see what experts and other participants think of them.

You might’ve already heard about the js13kGames competition, which has been running since 2012. Besides the fun challenge of squeezing your game’s assets into a 13 kilobyte zip package, another requirement is to provide the source code in a readable form on GitHub. The Gamedev.js community started around that time as well, but focused on local meetups and hackathons over the years, with the Gamedev.js Weekly newsletter being published regularly since 2014. Fast forward to 2020, when the first online Gamedev.js Jam was held, and the third edition in 2022 was the first to ask the developers to (optionally) provide the sources of their games.
